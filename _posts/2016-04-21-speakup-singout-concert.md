**SUSO Gospel Choir**

The SUSO gospel choir are on the go for 18 months and in that time they have acheived so much. They have held their own sold out concerts, performed at Gospel Rising Music Festival, been involved in lots of community projects and recorded with both Glen Hansard and The Riptide Movement! They have been working so hard towards this big show and cant wait to perform for you!

**Kilcock Mens Shed Choir**

Last year the Men sang one song for us, 'All Gods Creatures'. Theyt proved that they were well able and having had such phenomenal support from their community, they agreed that this year they would work a little harder and really get their singing voices in shape. You are in for a treat with performance from the newly formed Mens Shed Choir.

All proceeds for this event will go towards the Men's Shed in Kilcock. The men's shed have been building their little empire for over 18 months now, and in that time they have accomplished so much. Their space is transformed, new friendships have been forged, old friends are closer than ever, and together they are changing the lives of men in their community. The money from this concert is going to go towards a massive refurbishment project, in the upstairs space of the mens shed (above Vincents charity shop). Here the men are installing a social space and a comprehensive training area, as well as refurbing a kitchen. It is a very exciting project and is a massive addition to the town - your support is really appreciated!

Tickets cost €10 for adults, €5 for children, €20 for a family. Tickets are available from the Mens Shed, from SUSO Music School or from members of SUSO Gospel Choir!
