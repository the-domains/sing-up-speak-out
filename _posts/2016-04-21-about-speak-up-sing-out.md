# About Speak Up Sing Out

Hey Guys.. Claire, Eimear & Ailish here. We are delighted to be saying hello. It is our pleasure to be part of SpeakUp SingOut. We are about music & community & creativity & you! 

While the seeds of this organisation have been growing for many years, we only found our home & officially opened our doors in January 2015\. SpeakUp SingOut is ran by three sisters, Claire, Eimear and Ailish.

The space is a music school and a community facility and we offer extensive programs in everything from piano to drama, alternative nights to vocal classes, community projects to choral work. The ethos behind the school is one of acceptance, awareness, personal development and inclusivity. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5ca0bce9-ae9c-4dfd-b0ab-0fe4df655a5d.jpg)

**We believe any one can do anything** - it is never too late to open yourself up to creativity, it is never too late to experience the joy of trying a new thing, learning a new skill, making new friends and connections. We run programs for ages newborn to ninety plus - there is something here for everyone.
