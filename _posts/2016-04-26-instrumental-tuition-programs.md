We currently offer individual and group classes in piano, singing and guitar. One on one classes are 30 minutes long, and group classes are 40 minutes. All of our classes are taught with a focus on personal development and confidence building.

Claire has been developing her own style of teaching piano over the past 12 years. She teaches according to the learning style and musical preferences of the student. Whether you are interested in the more traditional exam route, or wish to explore your musical creativity and self-expression through improvisation and creative play, she will develop a program to best suit your needs. For young children, we recommend the group classes. These classes comprise of 3 children of a similar level, and are a fun way of learning the building blocks of music in a small group through the medium of piano. Claire also teaches adults from beginner to advanced levels. 

**Singing**

Singing is taught by Eimear. Eimear loves nothing more than teaching people how to sing and freeing the voice. Eimear knows and fully believes that anyone can sing, they just need to be given the tools to do so. To sing is a wonderful thing and Eimear loves to support that as much as possible. She does not teach exams, only free singing in a style that suits you. She has never met any one she couldnt teach so if you think you would like to challenge her record she would love to meet you. Eimear specialises in fear and stage fright and can help with these issues, as well as helping professional singers overcome any vocal issues or limitations. Eimear also teaches songwriting and can help you develop your style and free your inner creative genius! 

**Singing from the Heart**

Claire is a facilitator of the Naked Voice, a method of personal development through sound and singing developed by Chloe Goodchild. This method uses different vocal practices including mantra, working with the Indian scale as a way to access our own authentic voice and free sounding and singing as a way to freedom in our lives through sound and song. Claire runs monthly group chanting sessions with a focus on meditation through singing, and also offers one to one tuition in the Naked Voice method for those wishing to journey more deeply with their voice.
